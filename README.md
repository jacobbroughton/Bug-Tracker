# Bug-Tracker

This bug tracker allows users to log and keep track of errors that pop up during development.

Users will be able to see the progress of each tracked bug, and update the progress themselves.

CONTEXT AND REDUX

Use Context API for low frequency updates (ie auth, profile updates, etc.)

Use redux for high frequency updates (multiple per minute)
